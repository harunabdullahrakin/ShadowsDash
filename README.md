# Shadow's Dash is EOL. There is a full rework in the development, but not sure if it will be free/open source.

Shadow's Dash should be operational as the state as it is, but **no support will be provided at all.**
It is required to have at least some PHP knowledge and webserver configuration knowledge. I won't provide anything.
